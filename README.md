# This paper finds that banning single-family zoning laws costs $33,272 smaller than for Minneapolis than Saint Paul. Zoning laws increase housing values. When zoning laws are taken away, there's a drop in housing prices because there's an increase in the supply of available units. The following paper examines the effect of banning single-family zoning laws within Minneapolis. In December 2018, Minneapolis approved a housing plan, Minneapolis 2040, where 70% of the city's land will be banned from single-family zoning laws. The town approved building non-single-family homes in January 2020. I compared Minneapolis to a neighboring city, Saint Paul, from 2016-2021.
